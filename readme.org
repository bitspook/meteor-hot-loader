* meteor-hot-loader
Npm module to hot-pushing code into your meteor app.
** Why?
Meteor rebuilds (refreshes client) the app everytime a change is made. This module along with a companion meteor package `channikhabra:hot-loader` allow you to hot-push the code into your meteor app without refreshing the page.
** Install
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
[sudo] npm install -g meteor-hot-loader
#+END_SRC
You'll also need to install `channikhabra:hot-loader` package in your meteor app
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd /my/meteor/app
meteor add channikhabra:hot-loader
#+END_SRC
** Use
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd /my/meteor/app
meteor-hot-loader
#+END_SRC
This will hot-push code into your meteor app whenever you change a file in your meteor app. That includes client side code and code that runs on both client and server.
** But why a separate module?
[[https://github.com/channikhabra/channikhabra-hot-loader#why-separate-npm-module%5D][That]] is why.
** I want a meteor-only solution for this ðŸ˜¤
Well, I did implement a meteor-only way, but it isn't fast enough to be useable for the reasons mentioned above. You can give it a shot though: [[https://github.com/channikhabra/channikhabra-hot-loader-legacy][channikhabra:hot-loader-legacy]]
